#' A tabulation of births in the US in 2014
#'
#' The Centers for Disease Control collects data on all births registered
#' in the US (50 states + DC). The
#' full data set, \code{Natality_2014}, contains entries for
#' the full set of births keeping
#' only a subset of variables related to potential risk factors and outcomes.
#' \code{Natality_2014_100k}, \code{Natality_2014_10k}, \code{Natality_2014_1k} are random
#' samples of
#' size one-hundred thousand, ten thousand, and one thousand respectively
#' and are provided
#' automatically when the \code{natality2014} package is attached. A larger sample of one-million
#' cases, \code{Natality_2014_1000k}, and the complete set of cases in \code{Natality_2014} are also provided by the
#' package, but not through the usual \code{data()} interface. To access those large files,
#' see the instructions given in \code{Larger_natality_data_files}.
#'
#' Variable names are the same as in the original CDC file.
#'
#' Variables have been re-coded to translate markers like 99 into `NA` and to
#' self-document the levels of the variables.
#'
#' Note that the data include only registered births. Fetal deaths are not included.
#' For reference, there were about 24,000 fetal deaths (20 weeks and thereafter) in the US in 2013. (See \url{http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_08.pdf}.)
#' This corresponds to about 0.6% of the births listed in these data. The CDC also
#' reports about 16,000 infant deaths before age 28 days and another 7500 deaths before age 1 year.
#'
#' @details The smaller samples are nested in the larger ones. That is, all the cases
#' in \code{Natality_2014_10k} are included in \code{Natality_2014_1k}, and so on.
#' Larger data files are available by following the instructions in \code{Larger_natality_data_files}:
#' \code{Natality_2014} with 3.99 million cases and \code{Natality_2014_1000k} with a random sample
#' of one million cases
